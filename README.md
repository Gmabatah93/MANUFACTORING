# MANUFACTORING
_(dealing with waste: overproduction, idle time, logistics, inventory..., Just in Time)_
## Sample Projects
1. **Predictive Maintenance**
  - Unplanned downtime is the single largest contributor to manufacturing overhead costs.
  - This has led to embracing technologies like condition-based monitoring and predictive maintenance. Sensor data from machines are monitored continuously to detect anomalies (using models such as PCA-T2, one-class SVM, auto encoders, and logistic regression), diagnose failure modes (using classification models such as SVM, random forest, decision trees, and neural networks), predict the time to failure (TTF) (using combination of techniques such as survival analysis, lagging, curve fitting and regression models) and optimal maintenance time prediction (using operations research techniques)  
2. **Sales/Demand Forecasting**
  - Knowing the manufacturing volumes ahead of time helps in optimizing the resources such as supply chain, machine-product balancing, and workforce. Techniques ranging from linear regression models, ARIMA, lagging to more complicated models such as LSTM are being used today to optimize the resources.
3. **Inventory Management**
  - In such a highly competitive world, it has become necessary to forecast the demand of the customers in advance. Therefore, almost all of the manufacturing companies use Data Science for analyzing and predicting customer demands. It helps them manage the production and the supply chain. Also, it prevents the unnecessary production and congestion of orders. By this, the manufacturers have an advantage over inventory management as well. The stock of goods stored by them can thereby be used as per customer requirements and business needs.
4. **Predicting Quality**
5. **Price optimization**
  - These are raw material, machinery, labor cost, electricity, eliminated products, packaging, and supply.
6. **Warranty analysis**
7. **Managing supply chain risk**
  - Gathering of the requirement
  - Collecting raw materials
  - Gaining information about the market demand
  - Analyzing the resources for production
  - Programming the machines for producing goods
  - Employing skilled workers for operating machines
  - Checking the quality of the end product
  - Distribution of the product in the market
